Tested Podcast Annoations Chrome Extension
==============================================

This is a Chrome Extension designed to be used with the Tested.com Podcast Player

It allows users to add annotations to the podcast that popup up for everyone to see (like soundcloud). 
The purpose behind this is to allow users to add references to articles that are mentioned on the podcast.

It polls a server hosted on Google App Engine that stores the database of annotations.

Instructions
-------------

* You can add annotations by clicking the "Add Annotation" button on the podcast player. Whatever is typed into the "Comment" section will be displayed at the timestamp indicated. Links can be added to an annotation by using the syntax [Link Text]{Link Url}
* You can remove annotations by clicking the "Delete" button on an annotation
* Anyone can add/remove annotations, so please don't abuse the trust.
* Please don't link to porn or put offensive things in the annotations :)
